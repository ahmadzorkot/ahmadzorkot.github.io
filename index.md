Starting from September 2025, I am a postdoctoral researcher at the university of Vienna, in the group of Professor [Olga Mula](https://omula.gitlab.io/). I received my PhD in Applied Mathematics at the University of Limoges in June 2024, where my thesis was about numerical approximation to mean field games, under the supervision of [Francisco J. Silva](https://sites.google.com/site/franciscosilva2909/) and [Elisabetta Carlini](https://www1.mat.uniroma1.it/people/carlini/Personal.html).
You can find my manuscript [here](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04642299v1/file/2024LIMO0026.pdf).


## Research Interests:
